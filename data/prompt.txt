1. **Affected Individual**: Information about individuals directly impacted by a crisis.
2. **Caution and Advice**: Warnings, safety measures, or general advice to prevent or mitigate harm.  
3. **Displaced and Evacuations**: Reports of people displaced or evacuated due to a crisis.
4. **Donation and Volunteering**: Calls or information regarding donations and volunteer activities.  
5. **Infrastructure and Utilities Damage**: Details about damage to infrastructure, utilities, or essential services. Water outages or power outages belong here, as well as road closures, bridge collapses, and similar.
6. **Injured or Dead People**: Information about people injured or who have died due to a crisis.
7. **Missing and Found People**: Reports about individuals who are missing or have been found.  
8. **Requests or Needs**: Appeals or requests for aid, resources, or assistance.  
9. **Response Efforts**: Actions taken by authorities, organizations, or individuals to respond to the crisis. This includes rescue operations, police, firefighters, medical assistance, and similar.
10. **Sympathy and Support**: Expressions of sympathy, condolences, or support for those affected.  
11. **Not Humanitarian**: Posts that do not fit any of the above categories. Use this category only if no other category applies, ensuring every post is assigned to one category.

- Carefully read each social media post and determine which categories best represent the primary focus of the content.  
- Focus on the main theme or intent of the post, even if it contains information overlapping multiple categories.  
- **Always select at least a single category. If no other category applies, assign the post to "Not Humanitarian."**  
- Ensure the classification is as specific as possible while staying consistent with the definitions of each category.
